### The collection of design patterns:

- MVC OR 3 tiers : The UI, business logic and data object
- Abstract Factory: a generic function with factory. The factory will generate the desired object.
- Adapter: adapt one interface to another using whitelist
- Bridge: a client-provider middleman to soften interface changes
- Builder: call many little discrete methods rather than having a huge number of constructor parameters
