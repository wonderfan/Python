### The collection of design patterns:

- MVC OR 3 tiers : The UI, business logic and data object
- Abstract Factory: a generic function with factory. The factory will generate the desired object.
- Adapter: adapt one interface to another using whitelist
- Bridge: a client-provider middleman to soften interface changes
- Builder: call many little discrete methods rather than having a huge number of constructor parameters
- Catalog: general methods will call different specialized methods based on construction parameter
- Chain: apply a chain of successive handlers to try and process the data
- Chaining method: continue callback next object method
- Command: bundle a command and arguments to call later
- Composite: encapsulate and provide access to a number of different objects
- Decorator: wrap functionality with other functionality in order to affect outputs
